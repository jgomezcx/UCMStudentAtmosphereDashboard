## Notes

One of the biggest challenges I Had when working on this application was using the API to my advantage to be able to build the dashboard application that I did. I spent a lot of time looking at documentation for the api OpenWeather and WeatherBit so that i could extract the data I needed to accomplish displaying the necesary information on my application. The second hardest part was access, grabing the json objects from the response to the api call, and then doing something with that data. I struggled to find an api thast was not limiting with calls per day, 50/api calls a day for free tier, which postponed a lot of my work process. I had to wait two days to continue to pull from the api and that was the biggest hurdle of this project. lastly, I struggled a lot on displaying the right information, luckily the .map function makes it more easy but it still takes knowing the json and the api to be able to work with it properly and efficiently. Luckily, once i had figured out how to work around the API in the previous week, the hardest part about this week was figuring out the parameters and routes for my application. I managed to learn about the way routes work and struggled to think about how I would display the data from the provided parameters and the information from the api. it took a lot of structuring but in the end, it was all fun and a cool dashboard came out of it.
